                    I'm a student at Universitas Negeri Makassar, currently participating in the Bangkit program. I am particularly interested in cloud computing as it allows me to deepen my knowledge and sharpen my skills in web development using modern technologies. I love the excitement and sense of accomplishment that comes from finding solutions to challenges, whether it's in building websites, games, or mobile applications. My passion for problem-solving drives me to continuously learn and improve.

                <h2>Dicoding Course</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the description of my final project on Dicoding course. The project focused on building a responsive web application using the foundational web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For structuring the content, I applied semantic HTML elements like header, main, footer, article, and aside to ensure better accessibility and SEO. The design and layout were handled using modern CSS features, including Flexbox to create a flexible, responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
                    <br><br>
                    To enhance user experience, I also implemented basic interactivity using JavaScript. This includes a mobile-friendly navigation menu with a toggle button, which dynamically shows or hides the menu when clicked. The layout was designed with mobile-first principles, ensuring the website looks great on smaller screens, and scales smoothly on larger displays.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, I paid special attention to design aesthetics by using a consistent color scheme and typography. The project utilized external stylesheets for CSS, making the codebase clean and maintainable. This project not only demonstrated my understanding of web development fundamentals but also my ability to integrate responsive design and enhance usability for all types of users.
